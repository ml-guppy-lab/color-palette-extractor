# Color Palette Extractor 🎨

This project extracts the most visually soothing, dominant colors from any image and generates a beautiful color palette bar. It's ideal for anyone wanting to visualize the color essence of a photo in a quick, beginner-friendly way.

The extractor uses `colorgram.py` and `matplotlib` to select and display prominent colors from your chosen image, automatically saving each palette as a PNG file.
